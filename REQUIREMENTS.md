# Requirement

The experiment setting: In our paper, we conducted all experiments on a Linux machine equipped with two Intel Xeon Processors E5-2630 and 192GB RAM, where it has a total of 16 cores and 32 threads. Therefore, when running Homi by using the virtualbox with the different settings, it may differ from the experimental results on our paper. We recommand to run Homi with the VM image having 16GB RAM and four virtual processors.
